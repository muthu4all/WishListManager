	description = "This is an Android tutorial-project which demonstrates how to get started using ORMLite in your Android apps.  This simple app allows to create Wish-lists and wishes inside a wish-list.  On a DB level there are two entities: WishList and WishItem, joined by 1-M relationship.  ORMLite framework helps to manage the SQLite database without doing direct SQL-queries, but manipulating objects instead."
